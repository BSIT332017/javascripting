# Javascripting Homework Repository

This repository is for CCIS BSIT 3-3 '17-'18 only, and will only be specific for the Javascripting Lessons. Committing any other files that are not related to the course or the lessons will have certain repercussions to the whole section so be warned.

## How to Submit Your Homework

### Clone this repository

If you're using GitHub for Windows (the desktop app), once you enter your credentials to it, it should automatically detect your personal and organizational repositories. You can just use that to clone it.

If you're more of a terminal (command-prompt) person and you downloaded [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), you can just clone the repository by typing the command `git clone git@github.com:BSIT332017/javascripting.git`. This would clone the repository to your current working directory (where your command-prompt is currently pointed before you execute the command).

### Pull updates

Chances are that you'll not be the first one to pass your homework. If so, you should pull any updates from the remote repository before proceeding. To do this, look for the "Pull" button, or if you're using the command-prompt, inside the repository directory, issue a `git pull` command.

### Create a personal subfolder

After cloning and updating, create a subfolder inside the javascripting directory you just cloned. The subfolder should be named with your last name, and it should contain all the files you created for the javascripting lesson.

### Committing your work to your local copy of the repository

After creating a subfolder and copying the files that you need to submit in it, commit your work. If you're using GitHub for Windows, the commit button should be on the lower left portion of the app. It also shows all the files that you'll be committing to the repository.

### Pushing your work to the remote repository

Before pushing your work, do another `pull` to update your local repository copy since people may have pushed changes before you. There should be no merge conflicts since you'll all be working on your own subfolders. If, for some instance you encounter a merge conflict, contact your professor to assist for now (I'll teach you guys how to resolve conflicts later on).

After updating your code, you may now "Push" your work. Look for the Push button, or if you're using the command line, in the repository directory, issue a `git push` command.

After pushing your code, confirm that it's uploaded to GitHub by going to the [repository](https://github.com/BSIT332017/javascripting) and check if your subfolder is there.

## Questions?

Contact your professor thru Schoology if you have any questions.
